React is a javascript library for building UI
React is used to build a single page application
React allows us to create reusable component UI

React was created by FaceBook
React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory

Javascript -> 
var firstname=document.getElementById("fname").value;
fname is the id of the HTML Element and retreive the value entered
We are storing in the javascript variable called firstname

Javascript will manipulate the browser's DOM directly and manipulates the value
virtual -> something not existing physically. it is not there in reality
virtual is a temp memory
React will store your entire HTML Document as a virtual DOM (temp memory)-it will make all necessary changes in the virtual DOM before changing the browser DOM

react willchange only what needs to be changed
React finds out what changes have been made and changes only what needs to be changed


Once the virtual DOM has updated the react component compares the virtual dom updated with the snapshot of the virtual dom before the updation .
updated copy(modified)                          Before updation ->status (snapsnot)
By comparing the virtual DOM with pre updated  version, react figures out what exactly has to be changed
This process is called as Diffing

React -> cannot communicate with DB to get the data
React will interact thru RESTAPI services to fetch the data
We can connect to API using Axios / Fetch -> Library
It will get the data in JSOn Data

"name":"Deepa",
"age":45
display the data in html elements which will render the page


React is based on Javascript
JSX-> javascript XML
JSX allows us to write HTML in React
It has installed an extension called babel where we can write JS and HTML code together in react'


without JSX
const myElement=React.createElement('h1',{},'This is without the support of JSX');
const root=ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(myElement);


JSX
const myElement=<h1>With JSX</h1>;
const root=ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(myElement);


react project name -> everything should be in lowercase->MyFirstReactProject -> wrong
myfirstreactproject -> correct
Function/Class -> FirstExample /Firstexample -> correct
firstexample -> wrong




react files can have an extension .js or .jsx

React is a component based technology
2 ways to create a component
1. Function
2. class

function FunctionName()
{
return(//render any html code);
}

class component will inherit from React.Component class
class FirstExample extends React.Component
{
render()
{
//render the html code
}
}
class component-> we can have constructor to initialize the values
we can define properties
functions
functions can be associated with events 


css -> we define style which react components can use
how to refer css in react
import './firstclass.css'

to apply the styles for specific tag
<h1 className="body h1">My First React Class</h1>


Events in React
1. event function should follow camel casing
2. in .JSX you pass a function as a event handler rather than a string
3. prevent default behaviour , when we submit the page data , it should not reload the entire page content
functioname=(e)=>{
//event code
}
e.preventDefault(); expicitly
It will prevent the default behaviour of submitting

e ->is a synthetic event
they are as per w3cspec
we need not worry on cross browser compatability
In react like javascript we generally dont give or call addEventListener to add listeners to DOM elements after it is created
Instead just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered



show()
{
alert("Button clicked");
}

return(
<button onClick={()=>this.show()}/>

show=(e)=>{
}

<button onClick={this.show}/>

UI -> validation 
bootstrap can also be used with react


React , React-component , React-Renderer , babel
UI-> DOM Manipulation methods


UI-> State -> constructor -> retrieve the data
Props ->


Hooks -> Routing(navigation) 

Add,update, delete , image is stored in 64bitstring -> collection(friday)
